# ROYALNFT
immutable erc-721 NFT creator royalty broker with built in marketplace as sale price<br /> 
enabling every owner as creator<br />

The ROYALNFT.sol contract effectively enables a decentralized marketplace for unique digital assets using the ERC721 standard. It emphasizes the role of every NFT owner not just as a holder but as an active participant in the marketplace, with the capability to manage transactions directly related to their assets. Here's a concise overview of its utility and functions:

Utility of the Contract

    Royalty System: Ensures creators and deployers earn from each asset sale, supporting a sustainable revenue model that incentivizes ongoing creation and participation. This is especially useful in markets where assets like data sets or creative prompts are continually reused and retain intrinsic value.

    Decentralized Trading: Allows NFT owners to act as exchange agents who directly manage sales and negotiations within the asset framework, eliminating the need for intermediary brokers and central platforms.

    Owner Economy: Facilitates an environment where every owner can dynamically set sale prices and directly benefit from market activities. This decentralized control promotes a more resilient and flexible marketplace.

    Mint function: every owner can mint a new NFT and become a creator. Creator can set fixed royalty and percent royalty at mint. Owner can then use the built in sale price that will be triggered in the event that a buyer sends the price to the owner. This creates a truly decentralized marketplace where the NFT itself is the royalty broker.

Core Functions

    Minting: Owners can mint new NFTs, setting initial sale prices and embedding royalty information, ensuring that they and the deployer receive dues from future transactions.

    Price Management: Owners can adjust the sale prices of their NFTs, enabling them to respond to market conditions or personal financial needs.

    Secure Transactions: Implements safe, non-reentrant transactions for asset sales, including automatic royalty calculations and payouts, which support a fair distribution of revenue among all stakeholders involved in the asset lifecycle.

By integrating these features, the ROYALNFT contract facilitates a truly decentralized and owner-driven marketplace empowering owners as creators enhancing economic autonomy and participation in a royalty empowered data driven knowledge economy.
